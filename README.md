watchdog
===========

Have a sneaky cousin that uses your computer without permission?
Then here's a quick and dirty way to regularly monitor your comupter's desktop for changes.

watchdog continuously watches your desktop and mails you if anything changes on the screen.

Currently works on macs only. 

If you have time to fork it and update it for your favorite OS, I'd love to have your help!

//TODO: update and finalize this README.
